# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, mostly for my own use, but feel free to take anything you like.

# Installation
I install these using [GNU Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink the config files
for different programs to my home directory. Files for individual programs can be symlinked with
`stow foldername`. I was inspired to use `stow` after seeing [xero's dotfiles](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles).
